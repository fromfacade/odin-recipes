            <p>
                <h4><em>Step 1: Boil Macaroni</em></h4>
            
                    <p>
                        Don't forget to bring a pot of water to boil. Cook the elbow macaroni until <em>al dente</em>, which is about <strong>8 minutes</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong> For a thicker mac and cheese, make sure that you double the amount of macaroni. 
                    </p>

                <h4>Step 2: Make a Roux</h4>

                    <p>
                        While your macaroni is cooking, go ahead and being working on the <em>roux</em>. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.
                    </p>
                    
                    <em>
                        In order to make the roux, begin by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until its smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Double check that the milk doesn't burn while doing so.
                    </em>
                
                <h4>Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni</h4>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the most crucial step of the process: Add the Cheese! 
                        Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until it is smooth and melted. 
                        We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese would.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the macaroni is finished cooking, <em>drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.</em>
                    </p>

                    </p>
